You need download the dataset from moleculenet. https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1
Then preprocess the data with pre_processing_whole.py file to get drug_data/file/data.pkl

regression tasks has 3 main function and 3 corresponding model files
classification tasks has 3 main function and 3 corresponding model files.
And we have 2 specific logic to control the GAT and GCN dual modality model and GCN model. So we have total 8 main function and 7 model.

Then run the code
Step 1.
run In_memory_dataset_whole_SMILE.py file firstly to store the graph related matrix in memory.
Step 2.
run [train].py
